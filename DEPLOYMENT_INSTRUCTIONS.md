### 🔐 **Next Steps - GitHub Authentication Required:**

You need to authenticate with GitHub to complete the deployment. Choose one of these options:

#### **Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Select scopes: `repo`, `write:packages`, `admin:org`
4. Copy the generated token
5. Run this command:
```bash
cd "e:\downloads\New folder (4)\scout-platform"
git remote set-url origin https://studaiedutech-ui:<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/studaiedutech-ui/scout-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Option 2: GitHub CLI (Easiest)**
1. Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
2. Run:
```bash
gh auth login
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Option 3: SSH Key**
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "studaiedutech@gmail.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
3. Change remote URL:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:studaiedutech-ui/scout-platform.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 📦 **What Will Be Deployed:**

- Final assessment report confirming production readiness

### 🎯 **After Successful Push:**

Once authentication is complete and the code is pushed, you'll have:

1. **Complete S.C.O.U.T. platform in GitHub**
2. **Ready for immediate deployment** to any cloud provider
3. **CI/CD pipelines** that will automatically trigger
4. **Production-ready codebase** with enterprise features

### 🔧 **Quick Deploy Commands After Push:**

```bash
# Local development
docker-compose up -d
